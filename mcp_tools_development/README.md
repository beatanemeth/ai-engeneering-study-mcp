# Developing MCP Tools

The **`mcp_tools_development`** folder documents the process of designing and prototyping **MCP tools** based on structured content data (events, articles, and blog posts).
The goal is to enable a language model to answer analytics-style questions reliably by routing them to the correct tool.

## 1. Data Preparation

### Download Data

The following datasets were downloaded as a **JSON** files:

- Events
- Articles
- Blog posts

### Clean Data

After downloading, the data was cleaned and normalized to ensure:

- Consistent date formats
- Structured categories and tags
- Reliable numeric fields (attendance, views, likes, waitlist counts)

## 4. How to Organize MCP Tools?

After brainstorming, three main MCP tool categories were identified.

### 1. Aggregator Tools

**Goal:**
Answer questions like:

- “How many events were organized in 2024?”
- “How many articles were published in December 2023?”

**Pandas logic**

- Filter by date
- Return simple counts

---

### 2. Analyst Tools

**Goal:**
Answer questions like:

- “What was the total attendance in 2025?”
- “Which event was the most popular?”

**Pandas logic**

- Perform sums, averages, and rankings

---

### 3. Thematic Finder Tools

**Goal:**
Answer questions like:

- “What articles do we have about nutrition (Táplálkozás)?”
- “Show me posts with the #ManóDuma tag.”

**Pandas logic**

- Filter content and return **lists of relevant items**, not metrics.

---

## 5. Mapping Questions to MCP Tool Groups

**Note**: Mental Shortcut for Future Tools
When adding a new MCP tool, ask:

- **Is the answer a number?** → Aggregator
- **Is the answer a ranked or summed metric?** → Analyst
- **Is the answer a list of content?** → Thematic Finder

## 6. Making Hands Dirty

After the design phase, a **Jupyter Notebook** was used to prototype the MCP tools.
A simple implementation was chosen first, then gradually refactored into code suitable for use inside the `server.py` file.

This approach allowed fast iteration while keeping the final MCP tools clean and production-ready.
