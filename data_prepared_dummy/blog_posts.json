		"contentText": "Three months ago, I did something radical: I deleted every social media app from my phone for a weekend. I expected to feel free. Instead, I felt phantom vibrations in my pocket every ten minutes. My brain was literally wired to expect an interruption.\n\nWe live in an era of 'engineered urgency.' Every app is designed to make you feel like you're missing something vital. But let’s be honest: 99% of those notifications are digital noise. \n\nI remember a time when a ringing phone meant something specific. Now, a buzzing phone could be a life-changing email, or it could be a discount code for socks. Our nervous systems can't tell the difference between the two at the moment of the 'ping.'\n\nI decided to set boundaries. I created a 'Do Not Disturb' schedule that starts at 8 PM. I told my friends: 'If it's an emergency, call twice. Otherwise, I’ll see it in the morning.' \n\nAt first, the silence was deafening. But then, I started reading books again. I started finishing my sentences without checking my wrist. I realized that my attention is the most valuable currency I have, and I was spending it on things that didn't matter.\n\nChoosing not to respond immediately isn't rude; it's a survival strategy for the 21st century.",
