		"descriptionText": "Join us for the Annual Seed Exchange at Greenwood Garden led by master gardener Elena Rodriguez. \n\nThis event is for anyone—from seasoned growers to those who have never touched a trowel. \n\nTime: April 15, 2026, Wednesday, 09:00 AM to 12:00 PM.\nLocation: North Gate Entrance, Greenwood Park.\nMeeting Point: Near the central fountain between 08:30 and 09:00.\n\nOur Community Garden meetups are a chance to connect with neighbors and the earth. We share seeds, knowledge, and the labor of preparing the soil for the spring season. Whether you have heirloom tomatoes to trade or just want to learn how to start a window-box herb garden, there is a place for you here.\n\nTHE PROGRAM:\nSpring is a time of renewal. We will begin with a short talk on soil health, followed by the seed swap. Afterward, we'll spend an hour hands-on in the community plots, helping each other plant the first round of cool-weather crops.\n\nThis isn't just about gardening; it's about the 'social harvest'—the friendships and support networks we grow alongside our vegetables.\n\nLEADER:\nElena Rodriguez, Urban Agriculture Specialist\n\nFEE:\nFREE (Registration required for seed-packet prep).\n\nREGISTRATION PROCESS:\nPlease click 'Register' below. You will receive a confirmation email with a list of recommended tools to bring (gloves, small trowel, etc.). If you don't see it, check your junk folder.",
